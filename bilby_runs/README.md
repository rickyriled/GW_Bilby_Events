#Various Bilby Runs
each repository in here will correspond to different GW events, each
with at least 1 or more runs.

#Other Scripts:
--------------
1. get_bilby_data.py: returns the posterior, prior, evidence, likelihood,
and keys for a given run

2. meta_prior_analysis.py: its internal meathods can be used to (1) get the
bilby result object corresponding to a runs result, and (2) to get its
meta data and prior defintions
